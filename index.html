    <h3 style="font-weight:700;"> Polar bears could be lost by 2100 </h3>

    <h6 style="padding-bottom:30px; font-weight:100; font-size:20px;">
Around 22,000 to 31,000 polar bears remain in their natural habitat, and if the Arctic ice continues to melt at projected rates, the polar bear population will become extinct. 
Polar bears spend most of their time on floating sheets of sea ice hunting for their favorite food, seals. But as the Arctic has warmed in recent years, the ice is melting earlier. This gives the bears less time to hunt. So some bears might not be able to build up the fat they need to survive the rest of the year. 
If the population of seals increases without polar bears to control their population numbers, that could threaten the population of crustaceans and fish, an important food source for local human populations as well as other Arctic wildlife.
Scavengers like the Arctic fox and Arctic birds like the snowy owl depend on big kills from polar bears as sources of food as well. If they’re not killing seals, they’re cutting out another food source for wildlife.
By helping protect the polar bears, we are helping to make sure the Arctic food chain stays healthy, for the benefit of wildlife and people in and beyond the Arctic. With less sea ice, the bears are forced to stay longer on land. This is increasingly bringing them into contact with local people in Artic villages and towns, leading to polar bears and people being injured or killed in self-defense.
